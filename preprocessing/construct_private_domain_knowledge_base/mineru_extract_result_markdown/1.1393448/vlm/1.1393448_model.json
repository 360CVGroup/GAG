These studies support that the presence of Pt on the cathode is more essential for membrane degradation. Second purpose of this paper is to report the influence of electrocatalyst, GDL and types of membranes on membrane durability at open circuit voltage, i.e. OCV. It was confirmed that membrane was much less degraded on OCV test when using \"Asahi Kasei Advanced Membrane\" or using Pt:Co alloy as electrocatalyst. These results imply that the problem of membrane degradation during higher cell temperature operation under low humidification can be overcome by the further improvement of both membrane and electrocatalyst."
